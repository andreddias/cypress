Learning about cypress tool

### My first impressions
Documentation is good, but without documentation it's hard to find people talking about cypress, beacause this i created cypress in groups google, link here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cypress_testing

### Read more about javascript
.each( function ) - When called it iterates over the DOM elements that are part of the jQuery object. Each time the callback runs, it is passed the current loop iteration, beginning from 0. Font: http://api.jquery.com/each/

### Understandind the cypress page
![example](https://github.com/andreddias/cypress/blob/master/cypress.png)

### My first project
I have some difficulty using ids our classes at first, but this documentation is good, is main source: https://example.cypress.io/commands/actions the examples (...\integration\examples) is another good option 

### Mocha
Another important thing is: Cypress has adopted Mocha’s bdd syntax, which fits perfectly with both integration and unit testing. 
describe()

context()

it()

before()

beforeEach()

afterEach()

after()

.only()

.skip()
